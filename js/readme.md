# Movie App

I decided to dedicate more of my learning time to JavaScript, and to start from the basics. This app is made using Vanilla JS.
It is part of the "Modern JS From The Beginning" course. The html and most of the css was provided in the course. The JavaScript was written by me.

It is deployed to netlify and can be seen here: https://main--peppy-kitten-9f8ecb.netlify.app/
